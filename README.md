# java8-mooc

Oracle ran a Java 8 course in July 2015. Topics included lambdas, the streams API and collectors usage. 

This repo contains official exercises and personal how-to experimentation.

Syllabus areas covered included:  
* Apply Lambdas to everyday problems
* Convert anonymous classes to Lambda expressions
* Apply the Streams API to solve problems of sorting, identifying the most and least, and reducing duplicates
* Determine when to apply Lambdas (and when not to!)
* Use Collectors
* Improve performance with parallel streams
* Debug Lambda expressions
